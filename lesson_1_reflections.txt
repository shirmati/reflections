learned commands. mkdir to create a folder in the current directory.

#How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
since I can see what I've done before, I can easily revert any changes that weren't helpful and learn from my past mistakes (thus write better code!)

#What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros - every commit has logical seperation. it is customized by the developers to suit their needs.
cons - commits might be too big/small. 

#Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think because of their initial purpose. Coding invloves lots of files, related to each other. Docs - they are usually 
not related to each other, or else - they are all in the same file.

#How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
using git log helps me view all of the commits, the time they were made, author and msg.
That, along with git diff, allows me to see what werethe exact differences between the versions.

#How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I know that I'm able to view the differences I've made, and easily revert them (usig git checkout) to any specific version.

#Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
currently a sample project, than, for the mobile corse :)
