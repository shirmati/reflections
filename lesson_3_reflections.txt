When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

when I want to contribute with others, fork, otr work from different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

otherwise, the remote might hold onto a buggy version or a confidential one.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

fork is a way to get another remote with all the previous code from an original repository on github. It is seperate, and if the original
 author would like he can make me a contributor. I can also create another project out of it.
clones are a copy of a branch/remote and it's history.
branches are the collection of commits, and they relate to one master, in which they can be merged to.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

I can work on it off-line, having the latest copy that was stored on the repo
