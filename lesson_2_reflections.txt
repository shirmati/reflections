when I initiallize a repository, git createsa hidden folder in it, called  '.git' . This folder tracks the status of the files in it. It does not createany commits.
I need to do it if I want to track my changes of a folder who hasn't been tracked yet, with a source control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
it's different because it's only logical - nothing has been committed yet.
What value do you think it offers?
reviewing what I intend to commit, making sure it makes sense, giving me a second thought
